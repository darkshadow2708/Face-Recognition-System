# Face-Recognition-System
Using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifier to generate training data sets and then using k nearest neighbour Algorithm to find the best match for the test data from the already trained data sets.

face_data_collect.py :- It will generate the training data sets.
face_recognition.py :- Using knn algorithm,it will predict the best match for your test data from the trained data sets
